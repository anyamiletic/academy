# Internship programme

### Project proposal: MojParking app

A full-stack web app, airbnb lookalike with various features including authorization, maps, a messaging system, responsive design

### Backend stack

- NodeJS + Express + TypeScript
- MySQL
- MongoDB (for the chat feature)

- a starter project will be prepared which already sets up basic token-based authorization and a router + controller that can then be reused
- the tasks for the backend developer(s) will be to implement the chat feature and expand on the routes and controllers depending on the application features (eg. storing and changing user data, CRUD operations on posts), and possibly some expansion on the authorization module

### Frontend stack

- React + Redux + MaterialUI + scss

- a starter project will be prepared using `create-react-app` which includes basic routing and Redux setup with an example state/action/reducer that can be reused
- the tasks for frontend developers will be to create reusable UI components using MaterialUI, create a map module, add pages to the app, communicate with the backend through an API, add auth-based features to the app, add data validation and business logic where neeeded, implement a responsive design

### Design

- a designer would be given a set of features and a few existing web apps for reference, the task would be to create a simple, modern, responsive design while utilising as much of the MaterialUI components and guidelines as possible. The design can be presented in Figma or Zeplin, along with a design board including all colors, fonts, components etc used

### PM

- a pm would, in coordination with the lead developer, create tasks, keep track of the progress of current tasks and provide estimation for the 'client'. They would also hold daily meetings with the team and coordinate between different sub-teams. In case of any feature changes from the 'client', the PM would discuss these changes with the lead developer and designer, and communicate with the 'client'.

### QA

- the QA will (under supervision from a more senior QA engineer) perform manual testing on the app, verifying tasks and outlining bugs. The qa's job will be to create bug reports in the project management tool

### Common

#### Github

- the project will be on two DEVersity repositories, one for the frontend and one for the backend. Developers will get access to both repositores. 
- both repositories will utilize the Gitflow workflow
- developers will be expected to understand git basics, and be able to create branches, add sensible commit messages, open PRs, and deal with merge conflicts
- all PRs will be reviewed by the lead developer. A PR will not be merged before approval by the lead developer.

#### Workflow

- the team will use a project management tool like Trello or ClickUp. The lead developer will write task cards and assign them to the developers, and connect the task with the proper design / api documentation / learning resource. 
- a developer's job, once assigned to a card, will be to move that card in the Ready for Review column. The lead developer should then either approve the card and move it to the Ready for QA column, or ask for changes and move it back to the In Progress column
